## About Orbit

[Orbit](https://orbit.kiwi) is an open-source design system that aims to bring order and consistency to
Kiwi.com products as well as the processes behind building them. It elevates the user experience and increases
the speed and efficiency of how we design and build products.

This library allows developers to implement Orbit in a project
using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) for Android.

Orbit Compose builds upon Material 3 library. If you need an integration with Material 2, see
[Theming chapter](https://github.com/kiwicom/orbit-compose/blob/main/docs/02-foundation/04-color/theming.mdx).

## Setup

We publish our releases in [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/search?q=g:kiwi.orbit.compose). To use
this library, you can add the following dependencies to your **Gradle file**:

```
implementation("kiwi.orbit.compose:ui:<version>")
implementation("kiwi.orbit.compose:icons:<version>")
implementation("kiwi.orbit.compose:illustrations:<version>")
```

## How to use?

In order to use one of Orbit's components, simply add them to your Composable function.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyScreen() {
    Column(
        verticalArrangement = Arrangement.spacedBy(8.dp),
        modifier = Modifier.padding(16.dp)
    ) {
        val maxWidth = Modifier.fillMaxWidth()
      
        ButtonPrimary(onClick = {}, maxWidth) {
            Text("This is an Orbit primary button")
        }
  
        Spacer(modifier = Modifier.padding(4.dp))
  
        AlertCritical(
            title = { Text("Alert title") },
            content = { Text("Content description") },
            actions = {
                ButtonPrimary(onClick = {}) { Text("Primary") }
                ButtonSecondary(onClick = {}) { Text("Secondary") }
            },
        )
    }
}
```

Colors, typography, and other foundational elements can be used by accessing the `OrbitTheme` object:

```kotlin
Text("Title 1", emphasis = ContentEmphasis.Minor)
Text("Big title in Title 1 style", style = OrbitTheme.typography.title1)
Text("Check your typography styles!", color = OrbitTheme.colors.warning.normal)
```

</table>

### Icons and Illustrations

Icons and illustrations can be accessed in the same way, with the corresponding `Icons` and `Illustrations`
objects:

```kotlin
Image(painter = Illustrations.AppKiwi, contentDescription = "app_kiwi")
```
